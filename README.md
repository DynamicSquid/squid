# squid

This is the best thing I've ever made. Once I'm done, it will be a squid in the ocean and you go around swimming and collecting stuff.

And the cool part is that it's all done in the console.

Right now, I'm working on a Windows build, but it should also work for Linux as well in the future.

It's still not done, but I'll link the `exe` file as well so you can see my progress. Note that it may look very werid on Windows' Command Prompt since I have some trouble with the colours, but I'm working on fixing that.
